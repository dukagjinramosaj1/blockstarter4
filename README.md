* Participation in Update Meetings and Presentation [4]  
*As the supervisors mentioned in the kick-off everyone should be an active part of the group and participate in discussions during the update meetings. These meetings are mandatory. As the 10-minute presentation cannot be held by everyone in the team, members who were not as active before can score by presenting. The supervisors would give us hints, who could hold the presentation.*
